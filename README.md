# N-Queens Problem Solver with Multiple Search Algorithms:

Developed a program to solve the N-Queens problem using four different search algorithms: hill climbing, best first, backtracking, and genetic algorithms. The N-Queens problem involves placing N chess queens on an NxN chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.
    
- Implemented the hill climbing algorithm to find a local optimum solution for the N-Queens problem.
- Developed a best-first search algorithm using heuristic functions to guide the search towards better solutions.
- Implemented the backtracking algorithm to systematically explore all possible configurations and find the exact solution for the N-Queens problem.
- Utilized a genetic algorithm to evolve a population of solutions and find near-optimal or optimal solutions for the N-Queens problem.
